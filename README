    ===

    xfs indexes all your files for you so that they are all
    searchable via full text search. xfs on it's own only
    comes with a very minimal set of binaries:

      - xfs-watch    - handles watching over filesystem events
      - xfs-index    - indexes text associated with a filename
      - xfs-dispatch - handles dispatching events to the relevant handlers
      - xfs-text     - handles text files
      - xfs-pdf      - handles PDF files

    $ cat ~/.xfs_config
    {
        // comments are allowed!
        "watch": ["~/code/..."],
        "dispatch": [
            ["*.pdf", "xfs-pdf"],
            ["*",     "xfs-text"],
        ],
    }
